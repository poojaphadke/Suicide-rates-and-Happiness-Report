# Suicide-rates-and-Happiness-Report
This project attempts to answer the following questions:
What factors are most correlated with suicide rates in countries around the world? Are some factors generally relevant for all countries or are they relevant only for specific regions? Answering these questions will provide a framework for suicide rate prediction and insight for what factors to target in a prevention strategy.
